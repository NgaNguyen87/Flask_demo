# Flask on Heroku

This demo is to demo some concepts and
technologies from the 12-day course, including Git, Flask, JSON, Pandas,
Requests, Heroku, and Plotly for visualization.

The repository contains a basic template for a Flask configuration that will
work on Heroku. The stock data was fetched from Yahoo Finance, inspired by the Coding Room (https://projectcodeed.blogspot.com/2021/07/how-to-build-stock-tracker-with-plotly.html)
